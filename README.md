## Contribution

We welcome contributions from the community!

- Read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for our contributing guidelines.
- Please follow our code of conduct (if available).
- Check open issues or start a discussion to suggest features or report bugs.

## Database Choice

For simple projects and prototyping, **SQLite** is recommended:
- Easy to set up, no server required.
- Works out of the box with FastAPI and SQLModel/SQLAlchemy.

For scaling up or production, consider **PostgreSQL**:
- Robust, supports advanced features, handles concurrency well.

**How to switch:**  
Use an ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy/SQLModel) and configure your database connection using environment variables. This makes future migration seamless.

| Database   | Pros                        | Cons                  | Recommended For         |
|------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| SQLite     | Simple, file-based          | Not for high traffic  | Development, prototyping|
| PostgreSQL | Scalable, robust, secure    | Needs server setup    | Production, scaling up |
